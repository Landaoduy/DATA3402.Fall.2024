In order to do so, you will use object oriented programming to create a playable casino style black jack game where a computer dealer plays against n computer players and possibily one human player. If you don't know the rules of blackjack or card counting, please google it.\n",

    "* Dealer's actions are predefined by rules of the game (typically hit on 16).\n",
    "* The players should be aware of all shown cards so that they can count cards.\n",
    "* Each player could have a different strategy.\n",
